    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Building reusable abstractions for browser-based frontends is a
      widely addressed, but only partially solved problem.  Libraries
      such as <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI</a> provide
      developers already with a useful collection of commonly used UI
      elements.  This frees developers from having to implement, for
      example, interactive date picker widgets and allows them to focus
      more on the actual business logic.  However, such libraries come
      at a price: as soon as something is required, which is not
      provided by the library, things get messy.</p>
    <p>The new requirement can be fulfilled by extending the library,
      which requires knowledge of the library's inner workings.  The
      benefit of this approach is consistency.  The newly developed
      widget ideally behaves like the rest of the widgets provided by
      the library.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the requirement can be fulfilled by
      using <em>another</em> library or creating a custom
      implementation.  This approach can quickly lead to an inconsistent
      codebase but usually provides a faster way to a first
      implementation (based on the assumption that writing code is
      easier than reading it).</p>
    <p>I propose a set of rules, which are not tied to any framework or
    library, with the aim of facilitating the creation of reusable UI
    components.  The secondary goal of these rules is to do this without
    breaking <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive
    enhancement</a>.</p>
    <h1>The Rules</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Only one piece of code is allowed to mutate a given subtree
        of the DOM.  This is called <strong>owning</strong> a subtree.</p>
        <p><em>Rationale</em>: the DOM is global state and accessible to
        every piece of code.  As such, the usual principles for handling
        global variables should be applied to prevent the problems
        associated with global state.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All meaningful state is stored in the DOM.  Meaningful state
        is state that carries a meaning for the application, e.g. for a
        blogging application, state related to articles is most likely
        considered meaningful.</p>
        <p><em>Rationale</em>: Putting all meaningful state into the DOM
        enables the server to generate the state, and the client to work
        with this state.  It eliminates the need to serialize and
        deserialize data (e.g. using JSON or XML).  Also, the user agent
        does not need any capabilities beyond parsing HTML.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pieces of code communicate through events, using the DOM as
          the event bus.  Every public function should trigger events in
          order to notify other parts of the application about the
          function call.  Public functions should be invokable by
          triggering the appropriate event on the element <em>owned</em>
          by this piece of code.</p>
        <p><em>Rationale</em>: Triggering events for every function call
        on the DOM allows for easy delegation using event bubbling.  By
        making every public function available through the DOM, the DOM
        becomes the single interface to interact with the
        application.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Example</h1>
    <p>This is an example application built adhering to the rules
      described above.  It is a simple todo list application, allowing
      the creation and removal of todo items as well as marking them as
      &quot;done&quot;.  The count of items marked as &quot;done&quot;
      and the count of all items is display in the headline, next to the
      word &quot;Todos&quot;.</p>
    <div class="todo-application">
      <div class="todo-list">
        <!-- the template for new item -->
        <script type="text/x-html" class="todo-item-template">
          <li class="todo-item is-not-done">
            <input type="checkbox" name="done" class="todo-item-done" />
            <button class="action-delete">Remove</button>
            <div class="todo-item-content">
            </div>
          </li>
        </script>

        <h1>Todos
          <span class="todo-list-done-count">0</span>
          / <span class="todo-list-total-count">0</span>
        </h1>

        <form class="todo-item action-create" method="POST" action="todos">
          <fieldset>
            <legend>Create a new todo item</legend>
            <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT" />
            <input type="text" name="content" placeholder="Wash the dishes" />
            <input type="submit" value="Add" />
          </fieldset>
        </form>

        <ul class="todo-item-list">
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    <p><em>Note:</em> The implementation of the example presented above
    follows progressive enhancement only partially: the creation of new
    todo items is possible without JavaScript (given a matching server
    backend), the modification and deletion of items is not.</p>
    <p>The example application builds
    on <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> for DOM manipulation and
    event handling.  Components are defined using the
    function <code>Component.create(definition)</code>, which returns a
    constructor for a new UI component based on <code>definition</code>.
    Here are parts of the definition of a single todo item:</p>
      <pre><code><!--
-->{
  _namespace: "todo-list",
  _references: {
    "done": ".todo-item-done"
  },
  _events: {
    "change .todo-item-done": "toggle"
  },
  toggle: function(data, event) {
    if (this.$done.is(":checked")) {
      this.markDone();
    } else {
      this.markNotDone();
    }
  },
  markNotDone: function(data, event) {
    this.$root.removeClass("is-done").addClass("is-not-done");
  },
  markDone: function(data, event) {
    this.$root.addClass("is-done").removeClass("is-not-done");
  },
  remove: function(data, event) {
    this.$root.remove();
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <p><code>Component.create</code> treats some of these keys specially:
      <dl>
        <dt><code>_namespace</code></dt>
        <dd>This key specifies the namespace to use for binding
        events.</dd>
        <dt><code>_references</code></dt>
        <dd>A map of identifiers to CSS selectors.  During the
        initialization of a component, this map is used for creating
        cached jQuery collections on the instance.  A dollar sign is
        prefixed to the name to indicate this.  This is how the
        variable <code>this.$done</code> is defined in the example
        definition.</dd>
        <dt><code>_events</code></dt>
        <dd>A map of <code>(event, selector)</code>-tuples to method
        names.  This map is used for setting up event handlers during
        initialization.  In the example, the <code>toggle</code> method
        is invoked when the <code>change</code> event is triggered by an
          element in the todo item matching <code>.todo-item-done</code>.</dd>
      </dl></p>
    <p>All other keys starting with a lowercase letter and mapping to a
    function are recognized as method definitions.  The method
    definitions are wrapped to trigger events on the root DOM element of
    the component instance whenever the method is called: one before the
    method call (<code>before-$METHOD_NAME</code>) and one after the
    method call (<code>after-$METHOD_NAME</code>).  Additionally, the
    methods can be invoked by triggering a <code>do-$METHOD_NAME</code>
    event on said DOM element.</p>
